The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is a system-on-chip protocol bus for high performance buses to communicate with low power devices. 
There are two AMBA communication protocols which are Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) and Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB).
AHB protocol is used to communicate with a fast processor, a DSP or a high performance memory controllers (high performance systems)
APB protocol is used to communicate with low-bandwidth peripherals such as Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART).
AMBA system also contains a bridge which connects the AHB and APB buses 
Bridges are standard bus to bus interfaces that allows IPS connected to different buses to communicate with each other in a standardized way.
